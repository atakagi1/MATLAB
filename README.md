# MATLAB

MATLAB code and simulations described in the website:
https://atsushitakagi.wordpress.com/
are hosted here. 

If parts of the MATLAB code are used for publication,
please mention in the acknowledgements!

As of 15 September 2022 the entries are:

- Kalman filter basics
Learn how to implement a Kalman filter to obtain model-based estimates from noisy measurements, and to fuse measurements from multiple sensors.

- Finite horizion Linear Quadratic Regulator (simulation of one-dimensional reaching)
The basics of learning how to simulate and control a dynamic system, and demonstrate how a bell-shaped velocity profile is generated.

- Human-human goal integration
This code shows how to create a model of the partner to estimate their movement goal described in Takagi et al. (2017) (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0054). It also contains the original data from the human-human experiment conducted on the TVINS interface at ATR, Japan.
